<h1>ClimateWins: Advanced Machine Learning for Climate Prediction (Part 2)</h1>

This project expands on Climate Wins (Part 1) by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to help better analyse and predict the rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events over the past two decades.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

Climate Wins aims to explore and implement various machine learning approaches—including unsupervised learning, deep learning, and model optimisation to analyse weather data, identify patterns, and enhance climate prediction accuracy.

<b>1. Unsupervised Learning Models</b>

•  K-Means Clustering – Used to identify weather patterns and clusters in weather data over time.

•  Dendrograms and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Used for dimensionality reduction to simplify weather data and identify patterns or clusters within the data.


<b>2.  Complex Machine Learning Models</b>

• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Applied to analyze the dataset, with accuracy assessed based on prediction results.

• Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – Used to predict weather patterns by learning from historical time-series data.

• Random Forests – Applied to classify and predict weather events, with accuracy evaluated through model performance.


<b>3. Hyperparameter Optimisation</b>

• Random Search – Applied to test and optimise hyperparameters for machine learning models like random forests and deep learning.


<h1>Datasets</h1>

The following data sets were used for this project:

<b>1. Weather Conditions Dataseta</b>
Kaggle Dataset - this dataset includes images of various weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy.

<b>2. European Historical Weather Data</b>
This dataset includes historical weather data from various European cities used for training and testing weather prediction models.


<b>4. Handwritten Digits (MNIST)</b>
The MNIST dataset was used to train and test handwriting recognition models. This dataset contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

<b>5. Answers Dataset for Pleasant Weather Prediction</b>
Provided by Career Foundry, this dataset classifies days as "pleasant" (1) or "unpleasant" (0) based on weather observations.
It was utilized to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in predicting favorable weather conditions.
