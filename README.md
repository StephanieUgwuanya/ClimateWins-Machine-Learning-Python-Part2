<h1>ClimateWins: Advanced Machine Learning for Climate Prediction (Part 2)</h1>

This project expands on Climate Wins (Part 1) by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to help better analyse and predict the rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events over the past two decades.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

Climate Wins aims to explore and implement various machine learning approaches—including unsupervised learning, deep learning, and model optimisationvto analyze weather data, identify patterns, and enhance climate prediction accuracy.

<b>Machine Learning techniques used to help predict weather conditions:</b>

<b>• Unsupervised Learning – Finds patterns in weather data without predefined labels (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).</b>

<b>• Deep Learning (CNNs & RNNs) – Used for image recognition (handwriting/weather data) and sequence predictions.</b>

<b>• Generative Models (GANs) – Creates synthetic data and improves image quality for better predictions.</b>
