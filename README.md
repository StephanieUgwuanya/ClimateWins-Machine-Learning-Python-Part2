<h1>ClimateWins: Advanced Machine Learning for Climate Prediction (Part 2)</h1>

This project expands on Climate Wins (Part 1) by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to help better analyse and predict the rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events over the past two decades.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

Climate Wins aims to explore and implement various machine learning approaches—including unsupervised learning, deep learning, and model optimisationvto analyze weather data, identify patterns, and enhance climate prediction accuracy.

<b>1. Unsupervised Learning Models</b>

•  K-Means Clustering – Used to identify weather patterns and clusters in weather data over the last 80 years.

•  Dendrograms and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Used for dimensionality reduction to simplify weather data and identify patterns or clusters within the data.


<b>2.  Complex Machine Learning Models</b>

• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Applied to analyze the dataset, with accuracy assessed based on prediction results.

• Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – Used to predict weather patterns by learning from historical time-series data.

• Random Forests – Applied to classify and predict weather events, with accuracy evaluated through model performance.


<b>3. Hyperparameter Optimisation</b>

Random Search – Applied to test and optimise hyperparameters for machine learning models like random forests and deep learning.
